The Process should be simple for developers. we must let developers insert puzzles
where they wish.

A puzzle is a function that returns a constant

we must have a library with a puzzle function
library - hoffmankey.py

    Developer Procedure :
1) puzzle(name,vars) - developer uses this function in actual code
2) developer defines a function in puzzles.py with given name and vars as params.
3) developer returns some solution from the function.

Once the developer marks up there code like the following, they can test that
their own code works, and then they will be able to use our software to 
distribute their code.

In fact, we may be in verbal communication with the developer through the process.
